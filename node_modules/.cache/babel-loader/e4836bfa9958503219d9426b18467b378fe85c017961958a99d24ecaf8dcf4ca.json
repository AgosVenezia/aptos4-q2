This does not actually parse the input into a GraphQL DocumentNode like graphql-tag package does. It just returns the string with any variables given interpolated. Can save you a bit of performance and having to install another package.\n *\n * @example\n * ```\n * import { gql } from 'graphql-request'\n *\n * await request('https://foo.bar/graphql', gql`...`)\n * ```\n *\n * @remarks\n *\n * Several tools in the Node GraphQL ecosystem are hardcoded to specially treat any template tag named \"gql\". For example see this prettier issue: https://github.com/prettier/prettier/issues/4360. Using this template tag has no runtime effect beyond variable interpolation.\n */\nexport const gql = (chunks, ...variables) => {\n  return chunks.reduce((acc, chunk, index) => `${acc}${chunk}${index in variables ?
